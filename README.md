## App Brainstorming

**1.) Make a list of your favorite 3-5 applications and identify 2-3 features that make them your favorite app.**
* **Uber Eats**
* Sliding bar with various categories and fun graphic to easily access different menu items
* Search bar which pulls up suggestions if the user is unsure of what to search for
* Clearly organized sections with previous orders, recently viewed, etc in order for users to quickly access items they
  may have forgotten
*  **Crumbl Cookies**
* Navigation touchpoints is kept to a minimum with labels and representative graphics
* Wallet works seamlessly with in-store point of sales systems to reduce time spend ordering
* Home page contains bright media of featured product with easy access to order right away
*  **Lyft**
* Home page provides easy access to book a rideshare, as well as a map of current location with nearby rental bikes/scooters
  which makes it easy to find or request transportation right away
* When looking up a destination, Lyft provide ETA via car or bikes/scooters as well as upfront pricing
* Lyft provides the option to save destination in order to quickly select commonly visited addresses

**2.) Think of an app idea that you would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app.**
Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement.
* I would like to build a task manager to help those who may have ADHD or busy schedules. Traditional task managers require you
to input tasks and mark them as done, but this is flawed if someone forgets to write down tasks or return to a task.
Therefore, I would like to create a notification system that reminds users to record tasks throughout the day, and checks up on
users to see if they completed them. Additionally, the app would have a game-like aspect to motivate users to continue returning
to their tasks without being prompted.
I would also like the app to suggest tasks if a user continuously logs the same task or if a user visits a specific location.

## Notes

**Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.**
* Initially, it was difficult for me to add the logic, as x-code allows you to connect an element to logic by dragging a line to the
  correct spot. This is unlike traditional IDEs where you specify the element through code, so this was confusing for me. I wasn't sure
  if I was placing it in the correct area or how the two parts were connected, but after reading documentation, I eventually understood
  the steps.
